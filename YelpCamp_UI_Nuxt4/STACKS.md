Frontend:

Nuxt 4 (Vue 3 + SSR/SSG) - your Vue skills translate perfectly
Nuxt UI or shadcn-vue - modern component libraries
TailwindCSS - you know this already
VueUse - composition utilities
Pinia - state management (if needed beyond Nuxt's built-in)

Backend:

Hono - fast, edge-first, works great with Nuxt
Drizzle ORM + PostgreSQL - type-safe queries, better relational data than MongoDB
Lucia or Better-Auth - modern auth (replaces Passport.js)
Zod - validation (replaces express-validator)
Uploadthing or Cloudinary - campground image uploads

Full-Stack Type Safety:

tRPC - end-to-end type safety between Nuxt and Hono
